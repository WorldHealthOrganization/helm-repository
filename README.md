Repository of helm charts for WHO projects


The Chart File Structure
A chart is organized as a collection of files inside of a directory. The directory name is the name of the chart (without versioning information). Thus, a chart describing WordPress would be stored in a wordpress/ directory.

Inside of this directory, Helm will expect a structure that matches this:

wordpress/
 -  Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart
 -  LICENSE             # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing the license for the chart
 -  README.md           # OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file
 -  values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart
 -  values.schema.json  # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
 -  charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
 -  crds/               # Custom Resource Definitions
 -  templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                      # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
 -  templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes
 
 
Helm reserves use of the charts/, crds/, and templates/ directories, and of the listed file names. Other files will be left as they are.
